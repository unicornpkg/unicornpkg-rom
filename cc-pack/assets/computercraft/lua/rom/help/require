Implementation of require which is natively available in newer versions of CC : https://wiki.computercraft.cc/Require
Author and repo of this implementation : https://github.com/oddstr13/cc-require

Description : This method permits to load a library efficiently and can be called multiple times without causing any problem and has better performances compared to os.loadAPI()

Signature : require(<path to the library to load>) - the argument should be a string without extension

Usage :
local myLib = require("myLib")
myLib.foo()


Wonder how to create a library ? There is a simple pattern of what a library may look like :

local lib = {}

local function foo()
    print("Test of my library method !")
end
lib.foo = foo

return lib

OR

local lib = {}

local function lib.foo()
    print("Test of my library method !")
end

return lib
